                <p><strong>Technical Diploma - </strong>gives you the opportunity to understand the skills you need while allowing you to put these skills into practice. This will enable you to jump straight into the workforce with all the necessary knowledge and capabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Job Satisfaction - </strong>It’s important to find a career that you enjoy. After all, you’ll probably be spending eight hours or more a day, five days a week, at your job. Engineering can provide a satisfying field of work.</p>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Variety of Career Opportunities - </strong>From electrical and computer engineering to environmental and biomedical engineering, an engineering degree offers a wide range of career possibilities. But the majority of today’s college graduates will have more than one career during their work life, and engineering can provide a strong foundation for almost any one of them.</p>
                <p><strong>Potential to Benefit Society –</strong> an engineer, you can choose to work on projects that benefit society, such as cleaning up the environment, developing prosthetic aids for disabled persons, developing clean and efficient transportation systems, finding new sources of energy, alleviating the world’s hunger problems, and increasing the standard of living in underdeveloped countries.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenging Work – </strong>There is no shortage of challenging problems in engineering. There is no single answer, no answer in the back of the book, no professor to tell you that you are right or wrong. You must devise a solution and persuade others that your solution is the best one.</p>
                <p><strong>Intellectual Development– </strong>An engineering education will “exercise” your brain, developing your ability to think logically and to solve problems. These are skills that will be valuable throughout your life – and not only when you are solving engineering problems.</p>
                <p><strong>Creative Thinking -</strong> Engineering is by its very nature a creative profession. Because we are in a time of rapid social and technological changes, the need for engineers to think creatively is greater now than ever before. If you like to question, explore, invent, discover, and create, then engineering could be the ideal profession for you.</p>
